**Authors:** <a href = "drabb138@gmail.com">Dalton Rabb</a>

## Overview

This project analysis aims to highlight some of the key decisions Microsoft Studio's newly appointed head of movie production will have to make entering the competitive industry. From multiple data sets this analysis addresses three high-level production/release choices to consider in aims to start Microsoft Studios off with a box office success. 

## Business Problem

In order to get the proper funds necessary for success in the movie industry, Microsoft Studio decision makers will need to feel confidently informed on what makes a movie successful, and the biggest question -- how much money they will have to spend. I aim to answer how to get the best return on investment from production budget, genre selection, and most profitable release months. 

## Data Understanding

For my analysis, I used multiple datasets from IMBD and The Numbers that included ratings based off of popularity(in number of votes), genre category, release month, and return on investment from production budgets.  

### Release Month
The month of a release can have a big impact on the success of a movie. Historically, many studios release their biggest movies during the Summer or Holiday months when more people are going to the box office. To advise a handful of release months, I looked at the average worldwide gross by release month.

### Genre Selection

One of the most influential factors in a movie's success is that movie's genre. In order to advise what movies Microsoft studios should create, I looked at the most popular genres (rated by number of votes).

### Production Budget

Setting an appropriate production budget for a movie is one of the most important questions a stakeholder to have. This analysis got the average production budget for movies in the top 10% in worldwide gross sales.
