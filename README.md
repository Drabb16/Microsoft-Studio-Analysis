**Authors:** <a href = "drabb138@gmail.com">Dalton Rabb</a>

## Overview

This project analysis aims to highlight some of the key decisions Microsoft Studio's newly appointed head of movie production will have to make entering the competitive industry. From multiple data sets this analysis addresses three high-level production/release choices to consider in aims to start Microsoft Studios off with a box office success. 

## Business Problem

In order to get the proper funds necessary for success in the movie industry, Microsoft Studio decision makers will need to feel confidently informed on what makes a movie successful, and the biggest question -- how much money they will have to spend. I aim to answer how to get the best return on investment from production budget, genre selection, and most profitable release months. 

## Data Understanding

For my analysis, I used multiple datasets from IMBD and The Numbers that included ratings based off of popularity(in number of votes), genre category, release month, and return on investment from production budgets.  

### Release Month
The month of a release can have a big impact on the success of a movie. Historically, many studios release their biggest movies during the Summer or Holiday months when more people are going to the box office. To advise a handful of release months, I looked at the average worldwide gross by release month.

### Genre Selection

One of the most influential factors in a movie's success is that movie's genre. In order to advise what movies Microsoft studios should create, I looked at the most popular genres (rated by number of votes).

### Production Budget

Setting an appropriate production budget for a movie is one of the most important questions a stakeholder to have. This analysis got the average production budget for movies in the top 10% in worldwide gross sales. Not only are the sales much higher, but the return on investment is as well.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, my analysis lead to three critical suggestions for Microsoft Studios new production. 

<li>Microsoft studios should expect to allocate around <b>120 million dollars</b> to their production budget to generate worldwide sales in the top 10% of movies.</li>

<li>The release date should be set for <b>early Summer(May-July)</b> or during holiday season (November-December), since movies released during these periods have the highest revenue on average. </li>

<li>Microsoft Studios should create a movie fitting in the <b>sci-fi, adventure, or action</b> category as they are the most popular among movie fans.</li>
